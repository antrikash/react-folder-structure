This sample project is a TODO app which is inspired from Deloitte public website https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html

Its general functionality and features are below:

A. To showcase folder structure of enterprise level ReactJs app.
B. Use of React Router library to re route between different pages.
C. Use of important libraries such as TypeScript, SCSS for style purposes, react router dom for routing.

- public folder is generally used to link our JavaScript code with browser html.
- src folder is where we generally write our code of logic as well presentational component. The src/Components is further divided in multiple subsets like hooks(where we write the logic), redux(for state management), type( for typeScript type definitions) etc.
- assets folder contains constants and img files.
- domain is seggregated in 2 different domains such as todo and user.
  -multiple different pages are in page folder
  -we can have associated style files for each component and one common style or can say global style files which is in style folder.
- any common functions will be created in utility folder.
